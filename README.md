# typo3-live-templates

<!-- Plugin description -->
TYPO3 Live Templates: This plugin is currently under development. The goal is to provide as many TCA fields as possible, and possibly other snippets as well.

#### How does it work?

If you are in the PHP environment just open the Live Templates (CMD+J on mac) and start typing "tca". The possible fields then appear as auto-completion
